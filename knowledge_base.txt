under config\_default dir,
you have all config files...
params.toml has all the site parameters
languages.toml has language specific settings and parameters

under themes\anatole\layout\partials... you have partial html code for each block of the page stru
e.g. left side bar code is in sidebar.html.  
now in these partials - you can use parameters defined in parameters files.  if the parameter 
is defined at language level config file, then it will be picked up otherwise, higher level (hugo.toml)

for path, if you add "| relLangURL", then language level directory stru is taken... check 
how you have used it for youtube icon and google play icons.
