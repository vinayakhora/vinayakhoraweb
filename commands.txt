-Create a new post -
===================
Command : 

hugo new content content/en/posts/my-first-post.md   [this will create eng post, for each eng post

1. you have to have hindi post also, which is to be placed in content/hi folder]  

2. static pages has to be kept in content/post/en folder (hind in post/hi folder)

3. whenever you create a new post, it's header will have status as draft (draft = true), 
that you will have to change to "true"

modify content
===============

start hugo server - hugo server -D                    [-D will include draft post also]
output of the above command will give the url using which you can see the site.  make change to content
and see the change on the site.

config site
=============
hugo.toml is the main config file, where you specify template etc.

to publishe :
===============
1. you have to generate with command - 
hugo     [only this one word command]

When you publish your site, Hugo creates the entire static site in the public directory 
in the root of your project

2. I think, next you have to simply plublish on github and it will be automatically published.

template change
================

whenever you need to change content on the template pages such as the home page left side panel,
you have to modify the template itself.
for that -
