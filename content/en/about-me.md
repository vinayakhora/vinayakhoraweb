**Om Shri Ganeshaya Namah!**

**Namaste!** I am glad you are on this page and wish to know about me. My name is **Ram Mohan Kapil**. I was born into a Brahmin family of the **Kapil gotra**. My grandfather was a deeply spiritual man, content with what lord Rama gave him. It was he who gave me the name *“Ram”*, with the heartfelt wish that the divine name would be spoken and remembered as often as possible. My grandmother was also highly spiritual. Their life and values planted the first seeds of spirituality within me.

My father was a civil engineer, and my mother, a devoted homemaker.  She nurtured young minds by giving tuitions at home. From them, I learned discipline, sincerity and love for everyone.

I graduated from **Delhi University**, and soon after began my professional journey as a computer programmer with a Delhi-based startup. Over the years, I had the privilege of working with some of the largest corporate organizations such as Goldman Sachs, Reuters, American President Lines (APL), to name a few. My career took me to live and work in **America and England**, where I developed deep expertise in **software engineering and Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence**.

At this stage of my life, I have been fortunate to dedicate my skills and experience to public service. I have served as an **IT consultant to central and state government organizations**, contributing to projects of national importance such as **Aadhaar** and **GST**. My consultancy work has included engagements with the **Ministry of Finance**, **Ministry of Defence**, **Ministry of Agriculture**, and several other government bodies.

Alongside my professional journey, spirituality has remained a constant companion. From early childhood, I was drawn to our classical scriptures and often debated difficult questions. Around the year **2000**, I began studying astrology using the books available at home. My spiritual path deepened significantly in **2006**, when I came in contact with **The Art of Living**, an experience that transformed my life and gave new direction to my inner journey.

Being a software professional, I always carried a deep desire to preserve and share my knowledge of astrology through technology. With the inspiration and blessings of **Shri Hanuman Ji**, and heartfelt prayers to **Lord Ganesha**, this long-cherished dream finally took form.

On **1st January 2026**, I published the astrology application **“Vinayak Hora”** on the Google Play Store. This is only the beginning. I see infinite possibilities for enhancing the app, with the next major milestone being the integration of **AI-based predictive capabilities**.

This website and application are humble offerings born out of faith, learning, and experience. I sincerely seek your blessings, love, and continued feedback to help improve both the blog and the app.

**Namaste.** 🙏
