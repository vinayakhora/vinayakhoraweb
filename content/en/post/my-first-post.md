On **Mount Kailasa**, the divine abode of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, their two sons—**Kartikeya** and **Ganesha**—grew under the watchful presence of the gods.

One day, a friendly challenge arose between the brothers. To determine who was wiser, Lord Shiva proposed a test.

> **“The one who can travel around the entire world and return first shall be considered the most knowledgeable.”**

Without hesitation, Kartikeya mounted his peacock and set off at great speed. He flew across mountains and oceans, forests and kingdoms, circling the vast earth with determination and strength.

Ganesha, however, remained where he was.

Instead of rushing away, he calmly looked at his parents—**Shiva** and **Parvati**. With quiet devotion, he stood up and began to walk slowly around them, bowing respectfully as he completed each circle.

When he finished, Ganesha returned to his place and sat peacefully.

> **“I have completed my journey,”** he said.

The gathered gods were surprised. How could this compare to traveling the entire world?

Ganesha then explained:

> **“My parents are the source of all creation. Within them exist all worlds, all directions, and all beings. By circling them, I have truly traversed the entire universe.”**

When Kartikeya returned after his long journey, he found Ganesha already seated beside their parents.

Lord Shiva smiled, pleased by Ganesha’s wisdom. Goddess Parvati embraced her son with pride.

Thus, Ganesha was honored—not for speed or distance, but for insight—teaching that true wisdom lies in understanding the deeper meaning of the world rather than merely traveling through it.
